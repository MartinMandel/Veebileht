		<h1>The Fast and the Furious</h1>
			<p>Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) enjoys the adrenaline of street car racing
<br>and his fans treat him like a rock star. After a blazing encounter with the 
<br>ruthless Johnny Tran, Dom decides to take Brian (Paul Walker), a 
<br>newcomer to street racing, under his wing. Dom's sister Mia sees 
<br>something she likes in Brian, too. Trouble is, neither of them realize he's 
<br>an undercover cop, and Dominic and his rival Johnny Tran are both the 
<br>prime suspects in a case involving dirty money and big-rig hijacking.</p>
