		<h1>Fast & Furious 6 (2013)</h1>
			<p>Since Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) heist in Rio left them 
<br>and their crew very rich people, they've scattered across the globe; 
<br>however, they must still live as fugitives, unable to return home to their 
<br>families. Meanwhile, Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has been tracking 
<br>a gang of lethally skilled mercenary drivers whose second-in-command is 
<br>someone Dom knows. Unable to take them down himself, Hobbs asks 
<br>Dom and his crew for help in exchange for full pardons for everyone.</p>
