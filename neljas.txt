			<p>Dominic Toretto is forced to come out of hiding when a loved one is 
<br>brutally murdered. Heading to LA to track down the culprit, he crosses 
<br>paths with Brian O'Connor, the FBI agent whose undercover infiltration of 
<br>Toretto's gang led to the motorised miscreant's exile across the border. 
<br>The two men temporarily put their differences aside as they investigate 
<br>the killing.
